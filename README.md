# GOTHotels.com

A small app that lists reservations from a GraphQL backend and allows users to add a reservation.

For flair, the name of the hotel determines the house sigil for an avatar on the ListPage and determines Tyrion's message to the user before submitting the reservation on the AddReservation page.
